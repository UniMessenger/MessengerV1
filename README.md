Unimessenger is communication platform built on top of the ethereum blockhain. Unimessenger users can write and publish their messages or announcements for others to read, while the content creators retain full ownership of their content. All of this is written in smart contracts that are broadcast across the Ethereum blockchain, as documented on Github.
